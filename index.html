         <h1>A sample list of some of the subreddits that I subscribe to.</h1>
         <p>This isn't a complete list. I just wanted to pick a few things that I thought were representative of the things I like. Also, I get severe writer's block unless given a very specific topic to talk about (I have literally spent hours looking at a blank screen before when given too much freedom in a writing assignment), and this is what a friend told me to do.</p>
